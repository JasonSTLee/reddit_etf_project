# ðŸ“Š Reddit ETFs Project

Welcome to my my Reddit ETF project where I use PRAW (Python's Reddit API Wrapper) to extract comments from the ETF subreddit to find which ETFs are mentioned the most. This was a passion project of mine as both a Reddit user, and investor in ETFs based on the subreddit's knowledge and direction.
